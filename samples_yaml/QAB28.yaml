title: HHL Algorithm – Solution Qubit Dominance Check
description: >
  This quantum program implements a simplified version of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL)
  algorithm to solve a 2x2 linear system of equations using a 3-qubit circuit. The circuit
  approximates the inverse of a small Hermitian matrix A and encodes the solution to A·x=b
  in the amplitude of a solution qubit. The expected output is a dominant measurement in
  the |0⟩ state on the solution qubit. The task is to generate an assertion that checks
  whether the measurement distribution confirms this expected dominance.
