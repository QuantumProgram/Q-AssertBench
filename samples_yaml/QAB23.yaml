title: Grover's Algorithm – Marked State Detection
description: >
  This quantum program implements Grover's search algorithm on 3 qubits.
  The oracle marks two states, |101⟩ and |110⟩, and the diffusion operator
  amplifies their measurement probabilities. The expected result is that
  these marked states dominate the measurement outcomes.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies the dominance of the marked states.
