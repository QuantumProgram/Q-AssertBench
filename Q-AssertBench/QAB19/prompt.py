This quantum program implements Simonâ€™s algorithm with a hidden period.
The final measurement results of the input qubits are expected to satisfy a linear constraint with respect to the hidden string.
Insert an assertion into the program to check that the observed input results meet this constraint.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
