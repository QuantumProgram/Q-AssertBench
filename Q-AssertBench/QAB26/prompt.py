This quantum program implements the period-finding subroutine of Shor's algorithm.
For the example N=15, a=2, the expected measurement outcomes reveal a periodicity of r=4.
Insert an assertion into the program to verify that the observed results are consistent
with this period, i.e., that the measurement outcomes include the states corresponding
to multiples of 2 within the 3-bit register.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
