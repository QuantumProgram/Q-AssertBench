class PromptQAB05:
    text = """
This quantum circuit applies a combination of parameterized Pauli gates to a single qubit. 
The gates are applied in sequence and may interact in non-trivial ways to affect the measurement outcome probabilities.

Your task is to generate a code snippet that adds an assertion verifying whether the measurement results are consistent with the expected probabilistic behavior of the circuit.
Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
