This quantum program prepares a state using a series of controlled operations. The expected result is that only a small number of specific output patterns should appear in the final distribution.

Insert an assertion into the program to verify that the measurement outcomes are limited to a small, known subset of possible states.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
