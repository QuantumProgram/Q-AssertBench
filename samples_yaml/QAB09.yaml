title: Entanglement Correlation Detection
description: >
  This quantum program prepares a two-qubit quantum state where the measurement results of the qubits are expected to be strongly correlated.
  The goal is to generate an assertion that verifies this correlation, serving as evidence of entanglement in the system.
