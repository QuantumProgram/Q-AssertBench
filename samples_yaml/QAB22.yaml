title: Quantum Fourier Transform with Inverse (QFT + QFT†)
description: >
  This quantum program demonstrates that applying the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
  followed by its inverse (QFT†) recovers the original input state.
  In this example, the input state |101⟩ is prepared. After QFT and QFT†,
  the measurement results should be concentrated on |101⟩ (probability > 0.5).
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies this identity property.
