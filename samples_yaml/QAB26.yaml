title: Shor's Algorithm – Period Finding
description: >
  This quantum program demonstrates the period-finding subroutine of Shor's algorithm.
  For N=15 and a=2, the periodic function x ↦ 2^x mod 15 has period r=4.
  The expected measurement outcomes are consistent with multiples of 2
  in the computational basis (000, 010, 100, 110).
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies this periodicity.
