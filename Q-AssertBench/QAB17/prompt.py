This quantum program constructs the initial uniform superposition state required by Simonâ€™s algorithm.
The input qubits are placed into an equal superposition of all basis states before the oracle is applied.

Insert a verification step into the program that checks whether this uniform superposition is properly prepared.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
