This quantum program applies the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) followed by its inverse (QFTâ€ ).
For any input state, the combined transformation should recover the original state.
Insert an assertion into the program to verify that the output distribution matches the prepared input state.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
