title: Grover's Algorithm – Diffusion Operator Check
description: >
  This quantum program implements Grover's algorithm on 3 qubits.
  The oracle marks states |101⟩ and |110⟩, and the diffusion operator amplifies their probabilities.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies the amplification works correctly,
  by checking that the marked states dominate the final measurement results.
