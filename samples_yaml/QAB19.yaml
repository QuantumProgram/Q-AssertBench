title: Simon’s Algorithm – Final Constraint Check
description: >
  This quantum program implements Simon’s algorithm with hidden period a = "11".
  In the final step, the measurement results of the input qubits must satisfy the constraint z·a=0 (mod 2),
  where z is the observed bitstring and a is the hidden string.
  For a = "11", only '00' and '11' should appear, while '01' and '10' are invalid.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies this property in the observed results.
