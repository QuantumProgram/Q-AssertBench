title: Bernstein–Vazirani Algorithm and Uniform Superposition
description: >
  This quantum program implements the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm with three input qubits and one ancilla qubit.
  A critical step in the algorithm is the preparation of a uniform superposition across all input qubits.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies this uniform distribution, ensuring that the Hadamard
  layer has been correctly applied.
