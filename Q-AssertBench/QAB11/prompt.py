This quantum program implements the Deutsch algorithm for a specific oracle.
The expected measurement outcome of the first qubit is deterministic and corresponds to the nature of the oracle.
Insert an assertion into the program to check that the output matches the expected result for this oracle.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
