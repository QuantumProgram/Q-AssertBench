title: Pauli Gate and Probabilistic Distribution
description: >
  This quantum program applies a single parameterized Pauli gate to a qubit, resulting in a non-uniform measurement probability distribution.
  The goal is to generate an assertion that verifies whether the observed measurement statistics align with the expected probabilistic behavior.
