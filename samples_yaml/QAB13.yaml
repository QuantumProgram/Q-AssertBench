title: Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm with Fixed Balanced Oracle
description: >
  This quantum program implements the Deutsch Jozsa algorithm with two input qubits and one ancilla qubit.
  The oracle is fixed as a balanced function f(x0, x1) = x0 XOR x1.
  The expected measurement outcome is that the input qubits should never be observed as '00', which would indicate a constant function.
  The task is to insert an assertion that verifies this expected property.
