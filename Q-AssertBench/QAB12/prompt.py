This quantum program implements the Deutsch algorithm with a configurable oracle.
The oracle type is determined by a parameter, and the expected outcome of the measurement depends on this setting.

Insert an assertion into the program that verifies the consistency between the oracle parameter and the observed result.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
