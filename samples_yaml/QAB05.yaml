title: Continuous Pauli Gates
description: >
  This quantum program applies a series of Pauli gates (X, Y, Z) to a single qubit, influencing the final probability
  distribution of measurement outcomes. The goal is to generate an assertion that verifies the expected probabilistic
  behavior induced by the composition of non-commutative Pauli operations.
