This quantum program implements a simplified period-finding circuit for Shor's algorithm.
The measurement output must be classically post-processed using continued fraction expansion
to recover the period r of the modular function. Insert an assertion into the program
that verifies the continued fraction calculation correctly recovers the period r.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
