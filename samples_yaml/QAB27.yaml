title: Shor's Algorithm â€“ Continued Fraction Verification
description: >
  This quantum program demonstrates a simplified period-finding step of Shor's algorithm
  for N=15, a=2. The quantum measurement provides an approximation to k/r, which must be
  classically post-processed using continued fraction expansion. The expected result is
  a period r=4. The task is to generate an assertion that verifies the continued fraction
  step correctly recovers r=4 from the quantum output.
