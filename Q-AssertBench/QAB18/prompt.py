This quantum program implements Simonâ€™s algorithm with a hidden period.
After measuring the output register, the input register should collapse into a state
that appears in pairs related by the hidden string.

Insert an assertion into the program to verify that the input register measurement results
exhibit this pairwise structure.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
