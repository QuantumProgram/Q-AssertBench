This quantum program implements Grover's algorithm on 3 qubits.
Before the oracle and diffusion operator, the qubits should be prepared in a uniform superposition state.
Insert an assertion into the program to verify that this initial state preparation
indeed produces an approximately uniform distribution over all basis states.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
