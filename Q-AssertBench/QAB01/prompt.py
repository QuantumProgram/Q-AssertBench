Given the following quantum program, generate a single assertion that verifies the circuit produces a quantum state in which at least one qubit is in a classical state (i.e., always measured as 0 or 1), and at least one qubit is in a superposed state (i.e., measured probabilistically as both 0 and 1).
    
Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
