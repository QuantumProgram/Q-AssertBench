title: Simon’s Algorithm – Uniform Superposition Preparation
description: >
  This quantum program implements Simon’s algorithm with a hidden period a = "11".
  At the beginning of the algorithm, the input qubits are placed into a uniform superposition state.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies whether this uniform distribution has been correctly prepared.
