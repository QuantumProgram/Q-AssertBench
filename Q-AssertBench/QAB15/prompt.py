This quantum program implements the Bernsteinâ€“Vazirani algorithm.
At the beginning of the algorithm, the input qubits should be placed into a uniform superposition.
Insert an assertion into the program to verify that the prepared state indeed corresponds to a uniform distribution.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
