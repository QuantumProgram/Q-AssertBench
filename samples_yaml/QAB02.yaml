title: Bell State Preparation
description: >
  The program prepares a 2-qubit Bell state using a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate.
  The final quantum state should be an entangled state (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2, where both
  measurement outcomes appear with roughly equal probability. The goal is to assert
  whether the entanglement behavior is preserved through the measurements.
