This program constructs a periodic quantum state and applies the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).
The goal is to identify whether the output distribution contains peaks at the expected frequency components.
Insert a verification step that inspects the measurement output and determines if the quantum circuit produces
a valid QFT response to the periodic input.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
