title: Interference Control and Gate Direction
description: >
  This quantum program constructs a chained interference pattern using a sequence of controlled gates.
  Only specific output states are expected to appear if the control directions are correct.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies whether the measurement outcomes are confined to a small, known subset of possible states.
