This quantum program implements a simplified version of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm to solve a small linear system.
The circuit encodes a specific matrix A and input vector b, and is expected to produce measurement outcomes corresponding to a known solution.

Add a verification mechanism to the program that validates whether the output is dominated by the correct solution state.
This check should ensure that the result distribution aligns with the expected behavior of a quantum linear solver.

Include the assertion inline in the code, triggered after circuit execution.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
