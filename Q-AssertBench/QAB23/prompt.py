This quantum program implements Grover's search algorithm on 3 qubits.
The oracle marks specific target states, and the diffusion operator amplifies their probability.
Insert an assertion into the program to verify that the measurement results
are dominated by the marked target states.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
