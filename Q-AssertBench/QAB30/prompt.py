This quantum program is a large-scale instance inspired by Shorâ€™s algorithm. It uses 15 qubits to simulate the key structural phases of order-finding: uniform superposition, controlled modular operations, and quantum Fourier transform.

Insert an inline diagnostic check that validates whether the measurement results exhibit strong periodicity in the output distribution of the counting register.

Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
