title: Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) – Periodic Input Peaks
description: >
  This quantum program implements the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on 3 qubits.
  A periodic input state (|000⟩ + |100⟩)/√2 is prepared before applying QFT.
  The expected result is a non-uniform measurement distribution with strong peaks,
  reflecting the Fourier transform of the periodic input.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies the presence of these peaks
  in the observed distribution.
