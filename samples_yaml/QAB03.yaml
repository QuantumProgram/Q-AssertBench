title: Quantum Swap Gate
description: >
  This circuit initializes three qubits with fixed probabilities of measuring |1‚ü©,
  then applies two SWAP operations to move the quantum state of qubit 2 to qubit 0.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies whether the final measurement
  probability of qubit 0 matches that of the original qubit 2.
