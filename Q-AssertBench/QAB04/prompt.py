This quantum program applies a single parameterized Pauli gate to a qubit before measurement. 
The resulting measurement outcome is expected to follow a specific non-uniform probability distribution.

Your task is to generate a code snippet that adds an assertion verifying whether the observed measurement statistics reflect the expected probabilistic behavior.
Output the complete modified program with the assertion included. No explanations, no comments.
