title: Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm with Configurable Oracle
description: >
  This quantum program implements the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm with two input qubits and one ancilla qubit.
  The oracle type is determined by a parameter: oracle_type=0 corresponds to a constant function, while oracle_type=1 corresponds to a balanced function.
  The expected measurement outcomes differ accordingly:
  - For constant: the input qubits should be observed as '00'.
  - For balanced: the input qubits should not be observed as '00'.
  The task is to generate an assertion that verifies consistency between the oracle type and the observed measurement results.
