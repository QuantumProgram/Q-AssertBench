title: Grover's Algorithm â€“ High-QuBit Target Amplification
description: >
  This benchmark evaluates a 15-qubit implementation of Grover's algorithm. The task is
  to insert a diagnostic assertion that verifies whether the target bitstring is successfully
  amplified compared to other measurement outcomes. The circuit uses a controlled oracle and
  diffuser for amplitude amplification. A faulty variant disables the diffuser to simulate
  poor amplification, while the assertion checks if the target state is significantly more
  likely than any other.
